												<h2>Security</h2>
											
										</header>
										<p>Cloudflare can protect your website, make it run faster and improve availability with a simple change in DNS.
											The technology innovators at Cloudflare have re-thought the entire technology stack through the network,
											hardware and software layers, building out a reverse proxy service on a highly-available global network. By
											offering this functionality as a cloud service, it saves you time, money and hassle. Your web visitors are safer
											and happier while you continue to benefit from the continued innovation and the transformative web
											experiences that Cloudflare scale can drive. Cloudflare enterprise offers you a full suite of features available
											in business plus a lot more - priority access in local region, frequent analytics, mutli-user access, more
											caching options, custom WAF rules and priority traffic to local data centers.</p>

												<span class="image main"><img src="images/img1.png" alt="" /></span>
												<p>Cloudflare protects your web properties from Distributed Denial of
														Service (DDoS) attacks and other web threats before they hit your
														server. We recently mitigated an attack of 300 Gbps against one
														of our customers—an attack the New York Times termed “the
														largest in history.”.</p>
														<ul>
															<li>Advanced DDoS mitigation</li>
															<p>Provisioned as a service at the network edge, our service can
																	mitigate DDoS attacks including those that target the UDP
																	and ICMP protocols, SYN/ACK, DNS amplification and Layer
																	7 attacks.</p>
															<li>Dynamic Web Application Firewall</li>
															<p>Our Web Application Firewall (WAF) runs the OWASP
																	ModSecurity Core Rule Set and Cloudflare rule sets by
																	default, protecting you against SQL injection, cross-site
																	scripting (XSS) and application-specific attacks. Import or
																	write your own rule sets or add ones developed by industry
																	experts. New rules take effect in less than 30 seconds.</p>
															<li>PCI Compliance</li>
															<p>Utilizing Cloudflare’s WAF helps you cost effectively fulfill PCI
																	compliance. If you’re a merchant who handles consumer
																	credit card information, PCI DSS 2.0 and 3.0 Requirement 6.6.</p>
															<li>Collective Intelligence</li>
															<p>When one customer requests a new custom WAF rule, we
																	analyze whether it applies to all 6 million domains on our
																	network. If it does, we automatically apply that rule to
																	everybody on our network. The more web properties on our
																	network, the stronger our WAF gets, and the safer the
																	Cloudflare community becomes.</p>
															<li>Easy SSL</li>
															<p>SSL adds an additional layer of security for your website. Cloudflare works with SSL-enabled sites and handles SSL
																	termination without extra cost or hardware. Additionally, you can add your own SSL certificates or add new ones
																	managed by Cloudflare.</p>
															<li>Network Effect</li>
															<p>With our network of over 5.5 million websites and dynamic reputation scoring on more than 2 billion IPs per month,
																	we see attacks happen in real-time and can instantly deploy our learnings to protect every customer.</p>
															<li>Online, real-time reports</li>
															<p>Online, real-time reports. Cloudflare shows you the list of threats that have been stopped from reaching your website,
																	such as search engine crawlers, bots and potentially malicious visitors.</p>

								<header class="major">
										<h2 class="major">Performance</h2>
										<p>We cache static content, accelerate dynamic content and make it easy to optimize outbound content. Cloudflare goes
												beyond a traditional content delivery network (CDN) both locating your content closer to your site’s visitors but optimizing
												it for their device, browser and bandwidth needs.</p>
								</header>
							
										<article id="Performance">
												
												<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="" alt="" /></span> -->
											
														<ul >
															<li>Static content caching</li>
															<p>Cloudflare’s technology builds the cache for you based on your traffic and what objects on your site are safe to
																	serve. Use Page Rules to customize on a page-by-page basis and single file purge when you need to refresh your
																	content quickly.</p>
															<li>Dynamic content acceleration – Railgun</li>
															<p>Railgun is a WAN optimization service that ensures the connection between your origin server and the Cloudflare
																	network is lightning fast. It achieves up to a 99.6% compression ratio by only sending the differences between
																	subsequent dynamic requests. No content markup, configuration or code changes required!</p>
															<li>Wide range of front-end optimizations</li>
															<p>Cloudflare customers can use our one-click features to perform a wide range of content optimizations from
																	removing unnecessary characters from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to reducing the number of connections needed
																	to serve 3rd party widgets (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, ad servers, etc).</p>
															<li>Client Intelligence</li>
															<p>Cloudflare automatically detects the type of browser and connection a visitor is using and delivers your content the
																	fastest way possible. Your pages look the same as they did before, including any mobile version, but they are
																	optimized for the web visitors’ desktop or mobile environment.</p>
															<li>Fast, Powerful, and Secure DNS</li>
															<p>Cloudflare DNS is powered by the same network as our lightning-fast CDN. We resolve domains with the same 117
																	data centers that cache our users’ content, making us the fastest DNS provider globally. DNS changes propagate
																	orders of magnitude faster since we can avoid waiting for DNS TTLs to expire. This means migrating web hosts or
																	switching over to a disaster recovery server happens almost instantaneously.</p>
																	<li>Reporting</li>
																	<p>You’ll be able to see the exact speed benefits and savings with your personalized Cloudflare analytics report.</p>

									<h2>Advanced Addons for Cloudflare Enterprise</h2>
									</header>
								<article id="Advanced">
										<ul>
												<li>Argo Smart Routing</li>
												<p>Cloudflare routes 10% of all HTTP/HTTPS Internet traffic providing Argo with real-time intelligence on the true speed
														of network paths. Argo's smart routing algorithm uses real world network intelligence to route traffic through the
														fastest Cloudflare network paths, while maintaining open, secure connections to eliminate latency imposed by
														connection-setup. Argo’s tiered caching technology uses regional tier 1 Cloudflare data centers to propagate content
														to Cloudflare’s global network of 117+ Data Centers, minimizing requests to servers and reducing costs.</p>
												<li>Rate Limiting</li>
												<p>It protects against denial-of-service attacks, brute-force password attempts, and other types of abusive behavior
														targeting the application layer. Rate Limiting provides the ability to configure thresholds, define responses, and gain
														valuable insights into specific URLs of websites, applications, or API endpoints. It adds granular HTTP/HTTPS traffic
														control to complement Cloudflare’s DDoS protection and Web Application Firewall (WAF) solutions. Enterprise
														customers with Rate Limiting enabled gain access to enterprise-grade functionalities, including advanced analytics
														and range of time-out periods.</p>
														<li>Load Balancing</li>
														<p>Over-utilized or geographically distant servers add unnecessary latency and degrade the visitor experience. In many
																cases, unreliable or misconfigured servers drop visitor requests completely, preventing access to websites, web
																apps or APIs. Poor visitor experiences like these have a direct impact on revenue, reputation, and customer loyalty.
																Load Balancing safeguards from service disruptions with local and global traffic load balancing, geographic routing,
																server health checks, and failover, ensuring the continuous availability of your critical resources. Enterprise
																customers with Load Balancing enabled gain access to enterprise-grade functionalities, including per data center
																control and 5 second health check frequency across all origin servers.</p>
																<li>Dedicated SSL Certificate</li>
																<p>They are automatically generated and propagate throughout our global content delivery network, providing robust
																		encryption, along with lightning fast performance and compatibility. Dedicated SSL Certificates allow you to secure
																		multiple levels of your subdomains and include your fully qualified domain name in the Common Name (CN). The
																		best part is they eliminate the burden of generating private keys, creating certificate signing requests (CSR),
																		renewing certificates, revoking and reissuing after crypto vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed, and many of the other
																		maintenance tasks associated with traditional SSL certificates.</p>
